# terminalTimer

## goal
this app displays a timer or stopwatch in your terminal

## chosen language
c, because it's fast and close to hardware and the software doesn't need to be fancy.
... it just needs to display the time in a universal format.
also because i started using bspwm, i want to take advantage of terminal-centric software.

## libraries
i recently learned about the ncurses library, which was used to create terminal-centric games (i.e. "Rogue" 1980).
as this app just needs to update a string on the terminal every second, it seems very fitting for the job.
